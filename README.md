## what & whay? ( what is typescript and why we should learn it? )

typescript is an open-source programming language which is developed and maintained by microsoft
typed superset of javascript, that compiles to plain javascript. which is understud by the browser 

in other words you can say:-
Combine the javascript on which we work with ES6 or ES7 additional featchers and products

what is the reason to use typescript instead use other javascript libraries e.g Dart or coffeeScript or even plain old javascript 

1) Relation to javascript
:- typescript is suprier to its counterparts eg. coffeeScript Dart in the way that typescript just extended javascript. Dart and coffeeScript are new languages in themselves while typescript is not. Even you can rename js extension file to ts and it would work perfectly fine. 

2) Optional static typing and type inference
:- javascript is dynamically typed which means javascript does not know what type of variable is untill it is actually instantiated at run time which is too late. type script is  in other hand add type support to javascript as a result I have identified as and when you type  your code and during the compilation step. this result an less error prone code and avoiding having to wake up in the night to fix a production issue and the best part is specifying the type compeletly optional. when you don't specify the type. Typescript will infer the type for you and still pointout the errors which would be otherwise to be seen only during run time.

3) IDE support ( enhanced ide support)
:- With typescript we get intelegent support ability to refacter the code easily and the red squiggly the whenever there is an error along with the discription of that ever this helps you to spend more time on codeing and less time on debugging 

4) Rapid Growth and use 
:- typescript has seen rapid growth and usages in wide variety of applications typescript is main programming language of angular it has found its way in React and view as well. Micropsoft is actively working on the projects and features are being improved constantly. Very seoon you're going to hear a lot of typescript in the world of web.
Considring all these reasons i would say if you haven't aleady. It's great time to lean typescript. 

Before we get started with the concepts we need to set up our development envirnments.


## Envirnment setup
1). To work on typescript first you have to download and install node.js
:- Once it's installed to test use 
'node -v' to check node version

2).  to install typeScript
'npm install -g typescript' this will install typescript globally 
'tsc -v' to check version of typescript on your machine
